# Fundr Security Audit & Best Practices

## 🔒 Deployment Wallet Security

### Current Security Measures:
1. **GitHub Secrets**: Encrypted at rest, never exposed in logs
2. **Devnet Only**: This wallet only has test SOL, no real value
3. **Limited Scope**: Only used for program deployment
4. **Access Control**: Only GitHub Actions can access the secret

### Recommendations:
- ✅ Never use this wallet for mainnet funds
- ✅ Rotate keys before mainnet deployment
- ✅ Use a hardware wallet for mainnet deployments
- ✅ Enable GitHub's secret scanning

## 🛡️ Smart Contract Security Audit

### Automated Audit Tools:
1. **Soteria** - Solana security scanner
2. **Sec3** - Smart contract vulnerability detection
3. **Anchor Verify** - Built-in security checks

### Manual Audit Checklist:

#### 1. Access Control
- [ ] Owner-only functions properly restricted
- [ ] Manager permissions validated
- [ ] Investor rights protected

#### 2. Math Operations
- [ ] No integer overflow/underflow
- [ ] Proper decimal handling
- [ ] Fee calculations verified

#### 3. State Validation
- [ ] Input validation on all functions
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No uninitialized states

#### 4. Economic Security
- [ ] Withdrawal limits enforced
- [ ] Fee caps implemented
- [ ] No flash loan vulnerabilities

#### 5. Solana-Specific
- [ ] Rent exemption handled
- [ ] Account ownership verified
- [ ] PDA seeds properly derived

## 📋 Pre-Mainnet Security Checklist

### Before Mainnet Deployment:
1. **Professional Audit**
   - Hire firms like Kudelski, OtterSec, or Neodyme
   - Budget: $20-50k for comprehensive audit

2. **Bug Bounty Program**
   - Set up on Immunefi or Code4rena
   - Offer rewards for vulnerability discovery

3. **Multisig Deployment**
   - Use Squads Protocol for deployment
   - Require 2/3 signatures for upgrades

4. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement on-chain monitoring
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity

5. **Emergency Procedures**
   - Pause functionality ready
   - Incident response plan
   - Communication channels

## 🔍 Quick Security Check Commands

```bash
# Check for common vulnerabilities
anchor verify

# Run Soteria scanner
soteria scan programs/fundr

# Check account validation
grep -r "account_info" programs/fundr/src/

# Verify owner checks
grep -r "constraint.*owner" programs/fundr/src/
```

## 🚨 Current Security Status

### ✅ Implemented:
- Owner-only fund management
- Proper fee calculations
- Input validation
- Error handling

### ⚠️ Recommended Before Mainnet:
- Professional security audit
- Timelock for upgrades
- Multisig authority
- Rate limiting
- Emergency pause

## 💡 Security Best Practices

1. **Never Store Keys**: Private keys should never be in code
2. **Use PDAs**: Program Derived Addresses for escrow
3. **Validate Everything**: Check all account owners
4. **Limit Authority**: Minimize admin functions
5. **Test Extensively**: Fuzzing and edge cases

Remember: Security audits are essential before handling real funds!
