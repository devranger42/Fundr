Here is your **detailed concept outline** for the **Fundr** DApp — clean, specific, and stripped of anything unnecessary:

---

## 🧠 **Concept Name**: Fundr

### 🎯 **Core Idea**

A decentralized, noncustodial platform on Solana where anyone can create or invest in user-managed **on-chain funds**.

---

## 👤 **User Roles**

### 1. **Fund Managers**

* Create a fund
* Set a profit fee (0–20%)
* Allocate deposits into any Solana token using Jupiter
* Can rebalance portfolio anytime

### 2. **Investors**

* Browse funds
* Deposit SOL into a selected fund
* Withdraw anytime, receiving proportional value
* See ROI, token allocations, and fund manager history

---

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

### ✅ **Deposit**

* Investor deposits SOL into a fund
* 1% platform fee is deducted (goes to buy/burn of \$FUND token)
* Remaining SOL is converted to fund tokens per current allocation
* Shares are tracked in the contract (no LP token minted)

### 🔄 **Rebalancing**

* Fund manager calls a rebalance function
* Trades assets using Jupiter routing
* Fund state is updated on-chain

### 💸 **Withdraw**

* Investor withdraws any time
* Portfolio is sold proportionally across fund holdings
* Proceeds returned in SOL
* Manager profit fee is taken **only if there's a gain since deposit**

---

## 🔐 **Trust Model**

* Entire system is noncustodial and on-chain
* No lockups
* Fund balances and performance are provable
* Managers can’t rug or misappropriate funds

---

## 📊 **Token**

* Optional native token: `$FUND`
* 1% platform fee is used to buy and burn `$FUND`
* Token can be launched later via bonding curve (e.g. Let’s Bonk)
