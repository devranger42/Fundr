🏛️ Platform-Run Index Funds: Overview
The Fundr platform will feature a set of official, automated index-style funds curated by the platform team. These funds offer users a passive, trustless way to gain exposure to popular sectors, launchpads, or themes within the Solana ecosystem.

🧠 Purpose
Give users high-trust, low-effort investing options

Bootstrap liquidity and engagement across the platform

Showcase trends in the Solana ecosystem (meme coins, launchpads, utilities)

Act as default starter funds for new users

🧩 Core Characteristics
Non-custodial & onchain: Funds are built on the same smart contract architecture as user-created funds

Auto allocation mode only: Deposits and withdrawals are always proportional to the fund's current token mix

Platform-controlled: These funds are created and managed by the Fundr platform

Dynamic or curated rebalancing: Based on snapshots, trading volume, or manual adjustments

Leaderboard visible: Performance of platform-run funds is shown alongside user funds
