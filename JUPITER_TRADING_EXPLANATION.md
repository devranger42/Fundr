# How Jupiter Trading Works with Fund Funds

## ðŸ”„ Current Trading Flow

### 1. **Fund Structure**
- **Fund Vault (PDA)**: Holds all SOL and tokens for the fund
- **Manager Authority**: Only the manager can execute trades
- **Investor Shares**: Track proportional ownership

### 2. **How Trading Works**

#### Step 1: Manager Initiates Trade
```typescript
// Frontend: Manager selects trade
const swapData = await jupiterService.getSwapQuote({
  inputMint: "SOL",
  outputMint: "BONK",
  amount: 1000000000, // 1 SOL from fund
  slippage: 0.5
});
```

#### Step 2: Transaction Construction
```typescript
// Jupiter returns swap instructions
const swapIx = await jupiterService.getSwapTransaction(
  swapData,
  fundVaultPDA, // Fund vault is the token owner
  managerWallet // Manager signs the transaction
);
```

#### Step 3: Manager Signs & Executes
- Manager wallet signs the transaction
- Transaction includes:
  1. Transfer authority from fund vault to Jupiter
  2. Jupiter executes the swap
  3. Output tokens return to fund vault

### 3. **Security Model**

**What Happens:**
1. Fund vault (PDA) holds all assets
2. Manager creates swap transaction
3. Manager signs to authorize swap
4. Tokens stay in fund vault (never go to manager)

**What CANNOT Happen:**
- Manager cannot transfer funds to their wallet
- Manager cannot bypass Jupiter swaps
- Funds always return to the vault PDA

### 4. **Example Trade Flow**

```
Fund Vault: 100 SOL, 1M BONK
     â†“
Manager: "Swap 10 SOL for WIF"
     â†“
Jupiter: Creates swap transaction
     â†“
Manager: Signs transaction
     â†“
Fund Vault: 90 SOL, 1M BONK, 50K WIF
```

### 5. **Why This Architecture?**

**Benefits:**
- **Gas Efficient**: Complex swaps stay off-chain
- **Flexible**: Always uses latest Jupiter routes
- **Secure**: Funds never leave the vault
- **Transparent**: All trades on-chain

**Common Pattern:**
- Uniswap V3: Similar manager-controlled pools
- Yearn Finance: Strategists execute trades
- Index Coop: Managers rebalance indices

### 6. **Future Enhancement: CPI Trading**

To make it fully trustless, we could add:
```rust
pub fn execute_jupiter_swap(
    ctx: Context<ExecuteSwap>,
    jupiter_program_id: Pubkey,
    swap_data: Vec<u8>,
) -> Result<()> {
    // Validate swap parameters
    // CPI to Jupiter
    // Ensure output returns to vault
}
```

But this requires:
- Complex Jupiter CPI integration
- Higher transaction costs
- Less flexibility with routes

The current model (manager signs, Jupiter swaps, vault receives) is the standard for Solana DeFi and provides the best balance of security, efficiency, and flexibility.
